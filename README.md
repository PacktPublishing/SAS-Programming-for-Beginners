## About the Video Course
	SAS is a programming language designed specifically to analyze statistical data. SAS transforms data into insights, which can give you a fresh perspective on business. This course teaches you about SAS studio to write SAS code. 

In this course, you’ll learn how to get your data into SAS by reading data through various methods. You’ll see how to create SAS data and import SAS data. You’ll work with data by using conditional statements and functions in SAS. You’ll also learn about various SAS procedures to work with your data.
All of the concepts are covered using a structured, practical implementation through mini-projects. You’ll learn in a hands-on coding way, working in a SAS programming environment, and getting a detailed step-by-step explanation and implementation of each concept.
